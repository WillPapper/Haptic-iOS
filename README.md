# "Augmenting Reality" for the Visually Impaired

## Problem Statment

### How do we use artificial intelligence to make our digital tools more accessible to everyone? 

## Context
High level research into the potential market of visually impaired users revealed a global market reach of 285 million visually impaired individidals worldwide. Of that population: 
- 39 million are fully blind
- 246 million have low vision
- About 90% of the world's visually impaired live in developing countries.

Given that 90% of the world's visually impaired population lives in developing countries and only 13% are fully blind, we scoped our efforts to build AI-based digital tools that:

1. Are financially accessible to a wide range of demographics
2. Help bridge the digital and physical world
3. I
