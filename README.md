# "Augmenting Reality" for the Visually Impaired

## Problem Statement

### How do we use artificial intelligence to make our digital tools more accessible to everyone?

Visually impaired internet users like their sighted counterparts, benefit tremendously from the information and services the web has to offer. However, as web pages have become more complex the "screen readers" that visually impared users 

## Context
High level research into the potential market of visually impaired users revealed a global market reach of 285 million visually impaired individidals worldwide. Of that population: 
- 39 million are fully blind
- 246 million have low vision
- About 90% of the world's visually impaired live in developing countries.

### Demographic Considerations
Given that 90% of the world's visually impaired population live in developing countries, we felt it was important to incorporate addtional design considerations so that our prototype is:

1. Financially accessible to a wide range of demographics
2. Serves the needs of users in markets where internet access may not be consistent

### Design Considerations
Only 13% of the visually impared market is fully blind, which means that we have to design an experience that uses AI that augments physical and digital experiences for broad spectrum of users, some who are fully visually impaired and others who are less. As such, it will be important to design an experience that uses a wide range of sensory experiences including:

1. Auditory: Includes web and text to speech as well as other auditory based cues
2. Tactile: Touch-based queues and

### Technology Considerations
2. Touch can assist in providing orientation clues about a space. The key for the designer is to utilize the Texture optimally and considering the following
