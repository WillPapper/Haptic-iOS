# "Augmenting Reality" for the Visually Impaired

## Context
High level research into the potential market of visually impaired users revealed a global market reach of 285 million visually impaired individidals worldwide. Of that population: 
- 39 million are fully blind
- 246 million have low vision
- About 90% of the world's visually impaired live in developing countries.

Given that 90% of the world's visually impaired population lives in developing countries, we were able to scope our efforts to a specific subset of the population.
