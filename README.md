# "Augmenting Reality" for the Visually Impaired

## Problem Statement

### How do we use artificial intelligence to make our digital tools more accessible to everyone?

Visually impaired internet users like their sighted counterparts, benefit

## Context
High level research into the potential market of visually impaired users revealed a global market reach of 285 million visually impaired individidals worldwide. Of that population: 
- 39 million are fully blind
- 246 million have low vision
- About 90% of the world's visually impaired live in developing countries.

## Design Considerations
Given that 90% of the world's visually impaired population live in developing countries and 13% are fully blind, we felt it was important to incorporate addtional design considerations so that our prototype is:

1. Financially accessible to a wide range of demographics
2. Serves the needs of users in markets where internet access may not be consistent
3. Augments physical and digital experiences for users that are not fully visually impaired
